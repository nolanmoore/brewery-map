<p>This site is a small test site that was generated by the Yeoman Angular generator. It's purpose is to serve as a testing ground for random apps I make, giving me practice in this new skillset.</p>

<p>My background at this point as of February 2017 is largely in electrical engineering. I have designed and prototyped multiple flight controllers, motor controllers and power supply circuits.</p>

<p>I am learning web development as a side job and a potential new career. It's an interesting technology that I have fun writing for, and I think I'd be happy staying in this field for some time.</p>
